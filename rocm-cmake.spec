%description
rocm-cmake is a collection of CMake modules for common build and development
tasks within the ROCm project. It is therefore a build dependency for many of
the libraries that comprise the ROCm platform.

rocm-cmake is not required for building libraries or programs that use ROCm; it
is required for building some of the libraries that are a part of ROCm.
